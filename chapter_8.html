    <h4>Content</h4>
    <p>This chapter was about how to eat nicely in formal or job meals. Like when meeting a boss or client. Knowing these rules help us look smart and polite.</p>
    <p>We learned about table setup, using fork and knife, napkin rules, how to order food, and handle small problems like spilling water. We also talked about polite talk at the table and avoiding bad topics. Also, different countries have different eating rules.</p>

    <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>What to do and not do when eating at formal place.</li>
      <li>How to use plates and spoons right.</li>
      <li>How to talk nicely during meal.</li>
      <li>How to deal with small problems at table.</li>
      <li>Dining rules change in different countries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What Was Interesting</h4>
    <p>I was surprised to see how even eating has so many rules. Like waiting before eating or where to put napkin. These small things show respect and good manners. It made me see meals are also full of body language.</p>
