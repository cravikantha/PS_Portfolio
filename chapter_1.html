    <h4>Content</h4>
    <p>Professional skills, also called soft skills, are non-technical things that help in doing a job well. These skills go with technical knowledge to make a person more helpful at work. They work in many jobs. Like speaking clearly, working in teams, solving problems, thinking smart, using time well, and leading others. There are three kinds of work skills – technical, soft, and transferable. Values, beliefs, attitude, and character also affect how we act. Values help us choose right things. Beliefs change how we see the world. Attitude change our behavior. Character shows if someone is honest or strong. The Johari Window helps people know about themselves and others better. Learning these skills help us get jobs, work better, and grow in career. To improve, we should keep learning, use skills daily, take feedback, and try new things.</p>

    <p>This lesson teach me a lot about job skills and why they are important. We talk about communication, teamwork, problem solving, and other skills that help in job life. I liked the Johari Window – it show me how I see myself and how others see me. We did it alone and in group. I also learn about values, beliefs, and attitudes.
