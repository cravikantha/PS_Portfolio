    <h4>Content</h4>
    <p>This lesson was about knowing and managing our feelings and others’ feelings. This is called Emotional Intelligence (EQ). It is very useful at work to handle stress, talk well, lead teams, and solve problems.</p>
    <p>We learned the 5 parts of EQ: self-awareness, self-control, motivation, empathy, and social skills. We did some group work and case studies to see how EQ works. It helps to take feedback and keep learning.</p>

    <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>What EQ is and why it’s useful.</li>
      <li>5 parts of EQ.</li>
      <li>How to control stress and actions.</li>
      <li>Why empathy and social skills matter.</li>
      <li>Ways to grow emotional intelligence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What Was Interesting</h4>
    <p>What I liked most was how EQ is even more useful than IQ at work. Group work showed how many problems happen from bad emotions. I liked learning how to give feedback better by being kind and aware.</p>
