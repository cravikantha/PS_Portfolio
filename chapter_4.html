    <h4>Content</h4>
    <p>This chapter was about making a good CV for getting a job. A CV is a paper that tells about your study, skills, job history, and things you achieved. Employers look at it before calling you for interview, so it must look good.</p>
    <p>We learn to make CV clear, use bullet points, and choose simple font. It should have personal info, summary, work, study, skills, and awards. Put latest things first and use strong action words.</p>
    <p>Each job need different skills, so we must change CV to fit it. Checking company helps to use right words so CV pass the computer check. Also, we saw common mistakes to avoid. At last, we made our own CVs and got feedback. A good CV help you get more job calls.</p>

    <h4>What Was Interesting</h4>
    <p>I didn’t know small changes in CV make big difference. Changing it for every job and using right words to beat the computer check (ATS) was new to me. Before this, I thought CV is boring. But now I see it is like selling yourself in paper. That really changed my mind.</p>
