    <h4>Content</h4>
    <p>This was about how to talk in a smart way on phone and email at work. Even if we use phone and email every day, we forget how to talk nicely.</p>
    <p>First, we learned phone rules: speak clear, no eating while calling, and answer in 2–3 rings. We should greet nicely and talk in kind voice. Also, we learned how to put calls on hold or transfer in polite way. Take messages properly and end call nicely.</p>
    <p>Second, we learned email rules: Use proper email ID, write subject clearly, use “Dear” and “Regards,” and write with good grammar. No short words or emojis. Reply soon and keep it polite.</p>

    <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>How to speak well on phone and email.</li>
      <li>Words and tone show respect.</li>
      <li>How to answer, hold, and end calls.</li>
      <li>How to take and leave messages.</li>
      <li>Write subject line in emails clearly.</li>
      <li>What to write in email signature.</li>
      <li>Calls and emails show our image.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What Was Interesting</h4>
    <p>I found it crazy how small things like saying “Hold on” can sound rude. I also didn’t know email tone matters so much. Even saying “He is busy” can feel bad if we don’t explain. I learned every message is a chance to be more professional.</p>
