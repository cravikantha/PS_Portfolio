    <h4>Content</h4>
    <p>This lesson taught how to plan and do research. It’s helpful for projects in school or job. Research design means how we collect, study, and explain data.</p>
    <p>We learned about types of research – qualitative, quantitative, and both. We saw methods like surveys, interviews, and experiments. It also told us to define the problem, choose right sample, and follow rules.</p>

    <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>What makes a strong research plan.</li>
      <li>Different kinds of research.</li>
      <li>How to write good questions.</li>
