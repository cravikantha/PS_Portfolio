    <h4>Content</h4>
    <p>This lesson told how to face interviews with confidence. It said that both talking (verbal) and body language (non-verbal) are important. Verbal is what you say. Non-verbal is face, voice, eyes, and body.</p>
    <p>We learned to prepare well – like knowing company, knowing our strengths, and giving good examples. We used STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to give answers. It also showed what good and bad candidates do. Good ones smile, ask questions, and give clear answers.</p>
    <p>We also learned to talk about our skills, studies, and goals. Finally, we learned what to wear, take, and remember before going. This lesson helped us see that interviews are not just talking, but also showing our best self.</p>

    <h4>What Was Interesting</h4>
    <p>I was shocked to know that 93% of communication is body language, not words. I never thought that before. It showed me that being confident and positive matters a lot. I also liked the STAR method – it makes answers easy. These ideas will help me do better in interviews.</p>
