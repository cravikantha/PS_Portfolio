    <h4>Content</h4>
    <p>This chapter was about how to talk and agree in smart way. In jobs and life, we need to negotiate for things like salary, deals, or solving problems.</p>
    <p>We learned about two types: distributive (win-lose) and integrative (win-win). We saw steps of negotiation and tools like BATNA (Best Option if talk fails). Also, we learned how to stay calm and talk nice.</p>

    <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Steps and rules of negotiation.</li>
      <li>Why being ready is important.</li>
      <li>How to talk and compromise.</li>
      <li>How to control emotions in talks.</li>
      <li>Where to use negotiation in real life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What Was Interesting</h4>
    <p>I liked how being ready before talking makes a big difference. Role-play was fun and taught me how to stay calm and think fast. I saw that negotiation is not just about winning, but about helping both sides.</p>
